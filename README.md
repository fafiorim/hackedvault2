## Quick Start

1. Set up File Security Services:
```bash
export FSS_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

2. Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t bytevault:latest .

# Run with only user account (no admin)
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 \
  -e FSS_API_ENDPOINT="antimalware.us-1.cloudone.trendmicro.com:443" \
  -e FSS_API_KEY=$FSS_API_KEY \
  -e USER_USERNAME="user" \
  -e USER_PASSWORD="your_password" \
  -e FSS_CUSTOM_TAGS="env:bytevault,team:security" \
  -e SECURITY_MODE="prevent" \
  --name bytevault \
  bytevault:latest

# Or run with both user and admin accounts
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 \
  -e FSS_API_ENDPOINT="antimalware.us-1.cloudone.trendmicro.com:443" \
  -e FSS_API_KEY=$FSS_API_KEY \
  -e USER_USERNAME="user" \
  -e USER_PASSWORD="your_password" \
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME="admin" \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin_password" \
  -e FSS_CUSTOM_TAGS="env:bytevault,team:security" \
  -e SECURITY_MODE="prevent" \
  --name bytevault \
  bytevault:latest
```

3. Access the application:
- Web Interface: http://localhost:3000
- API Endpoints: http://localhost:3000/api/* (with Basic Auth)

## Security Modes

ByteVault supports three security modes:

### Disabled Mode (Default)
- Bypasses malware scanning
- Files are uploaded directly without scanning
- Maintains logging of uploads with clear "Not Scanned" status
- Suitable for trusted environments or testing
- Can be enabled/disabled by administrators only (when admin account is configured)

### Prevent Mode
- Blocks and deletes malicious files immediately
- Notifies users when malware is detected
- Provides highest security level
- Files marked as malicious are not stored

### Log Only Mode
- Allows all file uploads
- Logs and marks malicious files
- Warns users about detected threats
- Useful for testing and monitoring

## Authentication

ByteVault supports two authentication methods:

### Web Interface Authentication
- Session-based authentication
- Login through web interface at `/login`
- Configurable user credentials via environment variables
- Optional admin account for configuration management

### API Authentication
- Basic Authentication for all API endpoints
- Supports both user and admin credentials
- Works with standard API tools and curl commands
- Same credentials as web interface

### Default Credentials
- User Account (Required):
  - Configured via USER_USERNAME and USER_PASSWORD
  - Can upload and manage files
  - Cannot modify system configuration
- Admin Account (Optional):
  - Configured via ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD
  - Full access to all features
  - Can modify system configuration
  - If not configured, configuration changes are disabled

## API Reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Issues
- Verify correct credentials are being used
- Check if credentials contain special characters
- Ensure proper Basic Auth encoding for API calls
- Verify admin account is configured if attempting admin operations

#### Scanner Issues
- Verify FSS_API_KEY is set correctly
- Check scanner logs: `docker logs bytevault | grep scanner`
- Verify both ports (3000 and 3001) are accessible
- Check if security mode is not disabled

#### Configuration Issues
- Verify admin account is configured if trying to change settings
- Check if user has appropriate permissions
- Verify security mode settings

#### Upload Issues
- Check file permissions
- Verify scanner status
- Check upload size limits
- Verify correct credentials for API uploads
